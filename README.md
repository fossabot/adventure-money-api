*Ruby on Rails port of [adventure-money](https://code.google.com/archive/p/adventure-money/).*

Quickly calculate money shared each month between multiple people for multiple bills.

Extra features:

* Categories for organizing items that are always paid for and shared by the same people. 
* Summary view which breaks down the total cost for each month by category and/or individual payments. 
* Load and save accounts from human readable XML files. 
* Multiple windows can be opened at once to let you view and modify multiple sections of the application at one without switching between them.

## Usage

Calculate the money owed in your group in 4 steps: 
1. Enter the names of all the people in your house or group. 
2. Set the manager. He/she is the person that will receive money from everyone else at the end of the month. 
3. Add one or more payments (i.e. rent, electricity bill, shopping bill) and specify who paid for it, and which people share it. 
4. Adventure Money will divide up all the amounts based on who shared and paid for each bill and give you the amount each person owed.
